This is a simple app which was created to better understand PHP and relational databases/SQL queries.

### Customer Component
A customer is allowed to view a menu of products available in the coffee shop upon login. The customer can add a product to their cart. The customer can also view their order history. Once a customer adds the products to their cart, they can place the order.
### Barista
The barista logs in and views the orders which are still pending, and can mark them as complete

*** Note: This repository is missing a connection.php file which is necessary to connect to the database locally. I have included the sql file which can be used to create a database with all the necessary tables for this app
